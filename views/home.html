            <br>* 2.4 million emails are sent every second.
            <br>* That means that there are 205 billion emails sent everyday.
            <br>* That's 74 trillion every year!</p>
        <p class="story"><span style="font-size:2em;color:rgb(120,190,190);">Now consider this ...</span>
            <br>In a study conducted by the <span style="font-style:italic;color:white;">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</span>, email recipients
            <br>misinterpreted the tone of an email <span style="color:lightblue;">50%</span> of the time. Further, these recipients believed they
            <br>correctly interrupted the email <span style="color:lightblue;">90%</span> of the time. This means that almost 1.1 emails every second
            <br>are being misinterpreted even though the receiver thinks they interrupted it correctly.</p>
        <p class="story"><span style="font-size:2em;color:rgb(120,190,190);">So why does this matter:</span>
            <br>All of us are walking around confused, unsure and completely ambivalent of what we
            <br>should be doing, thinking or feeling based on the emails we are sending and receiving
            <br>causing much misdirection, angst, hard feelings, doubt, misguided direction and ultimately
            <br>a loss of productivity in are personal and professional lives. At Check Your Tone, we believe
            <br>this is wrong and we want to help. We invite you to upload your email, social posts, letters, memos</p>
